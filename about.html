	<div class="intro">Josefina Soto was born and grew up in Arequipa, Peru.  As a young adult, she traveled to Cusco where she was exposed to the fabrics, textures, and colors that are typical of the crafts of the indigenous population.  She experienced up close the dexterity with which these artisans create their ancient forms and patterns.
	<br><br>
	In her early 30's she moved to Brazil.  Not long after that, she started a family. Brazilian culture, with its emphasis on vivid colors and sounds, captivated her. It was at this time in her life that she first encountered Ikebana. She enrolled her oldest child in a Japanese school, which was run by the Japanese community living in Brazil.

	<div class="intro">Ikebana (生け花, 活け花, "arranging flowers" or "making flowers alive") is the Japanese art of flower arrangement.
		It is also known as Kadō (華道, "way of flowers"). The tradition dates back to the 7th century when floral offerings were made at altars. Later, they were placed in the tokonoma (alcove) of a home. Ikebana reached its first zenith in the 16th century under the influence of Buddhist tea masters and has grown over the centuries, with over 1,000 different schools in Japan and abroad.
		<br><Br>Kadō is counted as one of the three classical Japanese arts of refinement, along with kōdō for incense appreciation and chadō for tea and the tea ceremony.
